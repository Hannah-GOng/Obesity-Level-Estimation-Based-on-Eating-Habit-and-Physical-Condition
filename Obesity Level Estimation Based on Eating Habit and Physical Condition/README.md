**Proportional Odds Model On Estimation Obesity Level Based On Eating Habits and Physical Conditions**

## Introduction
The obesity epidemic has become one of the most serious public health problems globally. According to the research conducted by WHO in 2014, over 1900 million obese adults worldwide, which is double times compared to the number in 1980[1]. Previous research has shown that various social and behavioral factors can explain this rapid growth. Among them, unhealthy eating habits and lifestyle are two crucial risk factors for the development of obesity[3]. As the pandemic of COVID-19 enforced the practice of social-distancing and remote working, the altered eating behaviors and physical conditions such as longer screen time, intake of high caloric food, and reduced activity frequency may contribute to a higher risk of obesity. 

## Goal
This analysis aims to conduct a statistical analysis based on previous study data on obesity estimation, using the proportional odds model to assess *whether elements discussed in the study significantly predict obesity levels* and *whether the association between those behaviors or physical conditions obesity differs by gender*
